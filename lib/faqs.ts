    question: "What's the difference between organic and synthetic fertilizers?",
    answer:
      "Organic fertilizers are derived from plant or animal sources and release nutrients slowly as they break down. Synthetic fertilizers are manufactured chemically and provide nutrients immediately. Organic fertilizers improve soil structure and microbial activity, while synthetic fertilizers offer precise nutrient ratios and faster results.",

    question: "How often should I apply fertilizer to my crops?",
    answer:
      "Application frequency depends on crop type, growth stage, soil conditions, and fertilizer type. Generally, slow-release fertilizers require fewer applications (1-2 times per season), while water-soluble fertilizers may need more frequent application (every 2-4 weeks). Always follow product-specific instructions and consider soil testing to determine exact needs.",

    question: "What do the NPK numbers on fertilizer packages mean?",
    answer:
      "NPK refers to the three primary nutrients plants need: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). The numbers represent the percentage by weight of each nutrient in the fertilizer. For example, a 10-5-5 fertilizer contains 10% nitrogen, 5% phosphorus, and 5% potassium. Different plants and growth stages require different NPK ratios.",

    question: "How should I store my fertilizer products?",
    answer:
      "Store fertilizers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Keep them in their original containers with labels intact. Ensure they're out of reach of children and pets, and separate from food, seed, and pesticides. Liquid fertilizers should be stored above freezing temperatures, and all fertilizers should be protected from moisture to prevent caking or degradation.",

    question: "Are your organic fertilizers certified?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all our organic fertilizers are certified by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) and comply with USDA National Organic Program standards. Each product undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets organic certification requirements. Our certification documentation is available upon request.",

    question: "Can I mix different fertilizer products together?",
    answer:
      "While some fertilizers can be mixed, we generally recommend applying products separately to avoid potential chemical reactions that could reduce effectiveness or damage plants. If mixing is necessary, test a small amount first and check for precipitation or heat generation, which indicate incompatibility. Always consult product labels or contact our technical support team before mixing products.",

    question: "What's the shelf life of your fertilizers?",
    answer:
      "Dry granular fertilizers typically have a shelf life of 3-5 years when stored properly. Liquid fertilizers generally last 2-3 years. Organic products may have shorter shelf lives (1-2 years) due to their natural composition. Always check the product packaging for specific expiration information and store according to recommendations to maximize shelf life.",

    question: "Do you offer bulk pricing for large orders?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer volume discounts for bulk orders. Pricing tiers typically begin at 500kg for dry products and 200L for liquid products, with additional discounts at higher volumes. Please contact our sales team or your local distributor for current bulk pricing information and to discuss your specific requirements.",

    question: "How quickly do your fertilizers work?",
    answer:
      "Synthetic water-soluble fertilizers show results within days, while granular synthetic products typically take 1-2 weeks. Slow-release formulations provide nutrients over 2-9 months. Organic fertilizers work more gradually, often taking 2-6 weeks to show visible results as they need time to break down in the soil. Weather conditions and soil temperature also affect nutrient release rates.",

    question: "What shipping options are available?",
    answer:
      "We offer standard ground shipping (3-7 business days), expedited shipping (2-3 business days), and overnight options where available. For bulk orders, we provide freight shipping with pallet delivery. International shipping is available to select countries. Shipping costs are calculated based on weight, dimensions, and destination. Free shipping is available for orders over $500 within the continental US.",

    question: "Can your fertilizers be used in hydroponic systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer several products specifically formulated for hydroponic systems. These water-soluble fertilizers are designed to provide complete nutrition without clogging systems or creating precipitates. Look for products labeled 'Hydroponic Formula' or 'Solution Grade' in our catalog. Standard soil fertilizers are not recommended for hydroponic use as they may contain insoluble components.",

    question: "Are your products safe for organic food production?",
    answer:
      "Our OMRI-listed organic fertilizers are approved for use in certified organic food production. They contain no synthetic chemicals or GMO ingredients. Each batch is tested for contaminants to ensure safety and compliance with organic standards. Always verify that the specific product you're using is labeled for organic production if this is your requirement.",
